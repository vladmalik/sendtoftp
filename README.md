==============================================================

Batch file sends file to FTP server. Once file is uploaded (alas, no progress indicator), file opens automatically in the browser. Once there, you can use the "Chrome to Android" or "Fox to Android" extension shortcut to send this file directly to your Android device. If the file is a PDF, it will automatically open in the Acrobat app on the phone. Total 4 click from desktop to open on phone.
